Welcome to STEPCONF a graphical configuration program for EMC2.

Stepconf is a program that generates configuration files for 
LinuxCNC for a specific class of CNC machine: those that are 
controlled via a standard parallel port, and controlled by signals
 of type step & direction.

Stepconf places a file in the linuxcnc/config directory to 
store the choices for each configuration you create. When you
 change something, you need to pick the file that matches your 
 configuration name. The file extension is .stepconf.

The Stepconf Wizard works best with at least 800 x 600 screen 
resolution.
