This page only appears when Spindle PWM is chosen in 
the Parallel Port Pinout page for one of the outputs.

Spindle Speed Control

PWM Rate:
The carrier frequency of the PWM signal to the spindle. 
Enter 0 for PDM mode, which is useful for generating an 
analog control voltage. Refer to the documentation for your 
spindle controller for the appropriate value.

Speed 1 and 2, PWM 1 and 2:
The generated configuration file uses a simple linear 
relationship to determine the PWM value for a given RPM value. 
If the values are not known, they can be determined. For more
information see Determining Spindle Calibration.

Spindle-synchronized motion

When the appropriate signals from a spindle encoder are connected 
to LinuxCNC via HAL, LinuxCNC supports lathe threading. These 
signals are:

Spindle Index:
Is a pulse that occurs once per revolution of the spindle.

Spindle Phase A:
This is a pulse that occurs in multiple equally-spaced locations 
as the spindle turns.

Spindle Phase B (optional):
This is a second pulse that occurs, but with an offset from Spindle 
Phase A. The advantages to using both A and B are direction sensing, 
increased noise immunity, and increased resolution.

For Spindle Phase A and Spindle Index

Use Spindle-At-Speed:
With encoder feedback one can choose to have linuxcnc wait for the 
spindle to reach the commanded speed before feed moves. Select this 
 and set the close enough scale.

Speed Display Filter Gain:
Setting for adjusting the stability of the visual spindle speed display.

Cycles per revolution:
The number of cycles of the Spindle A signal during one revolution of 
the spindle. This option is only enabled when an input has been set to 
Spindle Phase A

Maximum speed in thread:
The maximum spindle speed used in threading. For a high spindle RPM or a 
spindle encoder with high resolution, a low value of BASE_PERIOD is required.
