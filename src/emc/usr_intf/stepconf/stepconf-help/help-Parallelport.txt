You may specify the address as a hexidecimal (often 0x378)
 or as linuxâ€™s default port number (probably 0)

For each pin, choose the signal which matches your parallel
 port pinout. Turn on the invert check box if the signal is
  inverted (0V for true/active, 5V for false/inactive).

Output pinout presets:
Automatically set pins 2 through 9 according to the Sherline
 standard (Direction on pins 2, 4, 6, 8) or the Xylotex standard
 (Direction on pins 3, 5, 7, 9).

Inputs and Outputs:
If the input or output is not used set the option to Unused.

External E Stop:
This can be selected from an input pin drop down box. A typical E
 Stop chain uses all normally closed contacts.

Homing & Limit Switches:
These can be selected from an input pin drop down box for most
 configurations.

Charge Pump:
If your driver board requires a charge pump signal select Charge
Pump from the drop down list for the output pin you wish to connect
to your charge pump input. The charge pump output is connected to 
the base thread by Stepconf. The charge pump output will be about 
1/2 of the maximum step rate shown on the Basic Machine Configuration page.
